* UI overlay window
  - [x] Implement a semi-transparent overlay window that displays on top of all other windows for debugging the captured frames.
  - [x] Ensure the application can be quit with a global keyboard shortcut (implemented via Ctrl-C, global shortcuts on Wayland are limited by design for security).
  - [ ] Add a notification area icon with a menu item to be able to quit the application.
  - [x] Add functionality via application config parameters (clap) to customize the opacity, size and position of the overlay window.
* Screen recording on Wayland (via dbus org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast)
  - [x] Get a pipewire handle for screen capture using the ScreenCast portal for a full screen.
    - [x] Capture only a specific application window (e.g. a game) instead of the full screen, configurable via clap.
  - [x] Use pipewire to connect to the stream and provide a callback with the video frames (see https://docs.pipewire.org/page_tutorial5.html).
  - [x] Only start capturing when a certain process is running (e.g. a game).
    - [x] Add functionality via application config parameters (clap) to customize the process name and check interval.
